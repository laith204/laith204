## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!
I'm a Computer Engineering junior at San Diego State University, specializing in embedded systems and FPGA development. I have a strong technical background in C, C++, Python, and Verilog, with hands-on experience designing and implementing hardware-software systems.

ðŸ”¹ What I Work On:

Embedded Systems â€“ Low-level programming, microcontrollers, and real-time applications.
FPGAs & Verilog â€“ Digital design, hardware acceleration, and custom logic implementations.
Automotive Projects â€“ Tinkering with car electronics, ECU programming, and performance tuning.
ðŸ”¹ Why I Love This Field:
I enjoy building efficient, optimized systems that bridge the gap between software and hardware. Whether it's writing firmware, designing FPGA architectures, or debugging a CAN bus issue in a car, I thrive on solving real-world engineering challenges.

ðŸ“‚ Check Out My Projects â€“ I'm always working on something new, from FPGA-based designs to embedded applications. Feel free to explore my repos!

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s Connect â€“ Open to collaboration, internships, and discussions about embedded systems, automotive tech, and FPGA development.
