## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My GitHub!
I'm a Computer Engineering undergrad at San Diego State University, specializing in embedded systems and FPGA development. I have a strong technical background in C, C++, Python, and Verilog, with hands-on experience designing and implementing hardware-software systems.

**ðŸ”¹ What I Work On**
- **Embedded Systems**  
  - Low-level programming and firmware development  
  - Microcontrollers, real-time applications, and hardware-software integration  

- **FPGAs & Verilog**  
  - Digital design, custom logic implementation, and hardware acceleration  
  - Working with RTL design, simulation, and FPGA-based computing  

- **Automotive Electronics & ECU Programming**  
  - Tinkering with car electronics, ECU programming, and immobilizer jailbreaking.  
  - Low-level debugging, electrical diagnostics, and CAN bus communication

  
ðŸ“‚ Check Out My Projects
I'm always working on something new, from FPGA-based designs to embedded applications. Feel free to explore my repositories!

ðŸš€ Letâ€™s Connect
Open to collaboration, internships, and discussions about embedded systems, automotive tech, and FPGA development.
